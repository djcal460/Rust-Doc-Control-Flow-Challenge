# Rustastic: Doc Control Flow Challenge 

### Rust Challenge 

Rust doc 3-part challenge. I created a error-checking prompt which prompts user for input of an integer. The integer is passed to a function to do work. In the first two cases a user is asked for a temperature in Fahrenheit which is converted to Celsius and vice versa. Next, the user is asked to enter a number to generate the nth Fibonacci number. Lastly, the user is asked if they want to hear a stupid song.

### Features

* Convert temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
* Generate the nth Fibonacci number.
* Print the lyrics to the Christmas carol “The Twelve Days of Christmas,” taking advantage of the repetition in the song.

### Tech

Tech uses the very very very advanced terminal shell and cargo compiler.


### Run the File
```
$ cargo run
```
